## What is the ZUI?

<br/>
The ZUI is a modern and responsive front-end framework based on Zywave's established design standards.   It's the living domain of our visual language that serves as our guide to creating first-rate partner solutions with ease. The ZUI is custom-made by our Zywave team to fit our specific needs; it's not a definitive guide on development, design, or documentation.
